## Q1 Circle and Rectangle overlapping
You are given a circle represented as (radius, xCenter, yCenter) and an axis-aligned rectangle represented as (x1, y1, x2, y2), where (x1, y1) are the coordinates of the bottom-left corner, and (x2, y2) are the coordinates of the top-right corner of the rectangle.
Return true if the circle and rectangle are overlapped otherwise return false. In other words, check if there is any point (xi, yi) that belongs to the circle and the rectangle at the same time.

## Q2 Determine if two strings are close
Two strings are considered close if you can attain one from the other using the following operations:
Operation 1: Swap any two existing characters.
For example, abcde -> aecdb
Operation 2: Transform every occurrence of one existing character into another existing character, and do the same with the other character.
For example, aacabb -> bbcbaa (all a's turn into b's, and all b's turn into a's)
You can use the operations on either string as many times as necessary.
Given two strings, word1 and word2, return true if word1 and word2 are close, and false otherwise.
